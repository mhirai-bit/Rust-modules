struct Counter {

// we want our count to start at one, so let's add a new() method to help.
// This isn't strictly necessary, but is convenient. Note that we start
// 'count' at zero, we'll see why in 'next()''s implementation below.

// Then, we implement 'Iterator' for our 'Counter':

    type Item = usize;

    // next() is the only required method
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        // Increment our count. This is why we started at zero.
